# Pygsear
### http://www.nongnu.org/pygsear/ 
### Installation 
have not yet been able to install 

" *nix:

If you are satisfied, and want to install the package
files, do this command as root:

python setup.py install
"

After running command I received 

"Kristinas-MacBook-Air:~ kristinaholsapple$ python3 setup.py install

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'setup.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
"

### Documentation: 
Documentation is incomplete. Absolutely necessary class and method documentation 
appears to be complete (Game module, screen module) but some methods are not documented.
When documentation is missing, the creator often refers to examples for further explanation/
demonstration. 

### Example Code: 
Plenty of examples are available. Viewing and reading the examples made more 
sense than reading the documentation (not sure if that speaks more to the documentation
or the code). Examples I have viewed seem fairly simple to follow. I have not been
able to play the examples yet, as I have not yet been able to download pygsear.
