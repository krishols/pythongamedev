# Pyzzle
### http://pyzzle.sourceforge.net/
### Installation
From pyzzle website: 

"Dependencies
Required to run from source:

Linux:

Pygame - 1.5.3

Python - 2.2.1

SDL - 1.2.5

SDL_image - 1.2.2

SDL_ttf - 2.0.5

SDL_mixer - 1.2.4

SMPEG - 0.4.4"

Haven't downloaded these yet so haven't been able to run pyzzle. On the fence
about a library with so many required downloads. 

### Documentation 
Documentation for newest (2010) version is complete. 
Written in user-friendly terms, including text/commentary supplemental to rigid 
code explanation. 

### Properties
Pyzzle functions through databases (? haven't looked into enough to understand this 
aspect), and items (compromised of slides and hotspots that work together). Properties
seem simple in explanation without much further investigation as of yet.


### Examples 
Download comes with an example game environment, but I have been unable to run it
because I have not yet downloaded all necessary dependent programs.
