# Spyre 
## Spyre relies on Python, Pygame, and PyOpenGL 
Is it worth looking into a OpenGL rendering engine? I am not completely familiar
with OpenGL past a basic Google search-not sure if it is worth adding another layer 
of complexity to a CS1  curriculum. 

### Documentation 
Documentation is mostly camera use/movement and light effects.
