# Spyre 
# Unusable: Outdated
  last updated in 2006
## Spyre relies on Python, Pygame, and PyOpenGL 
Is it worth looking into a OpenGL rendering engine? I am not completely familiar
with OpenGL past a basic Google search-not sure if it is worth adding another layer 
of complexity to a CS1  curriculum. 

### Installation 
"- A functioning "OpenGL", http://www.opengl.org/ system.  Those
      who do not have any special OpenGL-supporting hardware can
      install "MesaGL", http://www.mesa3d.org/.

   - "PyOpenGL 2.x", http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/ or greater.

- "Pygame 1.6" or greater, http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml"

### Documentation 
Documentation is mostly camera use/movement and light effects.
