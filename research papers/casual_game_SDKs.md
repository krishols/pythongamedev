### aim 
* implement game development into programming education: 
    * content: programming constructs
    * context: game dev. 
* provide flexibility and ease of use to professors with little gaming experience 
### background research
reiterates three methods of learning with games: 
1. little/no game programming
2. learn by playing custom games
3. individual gaming assignments
4. specialized gaming environments 
    
### methodology
"A GTCS SDK for CS1/2 courses includes:
 1. a fun and engaging custom casual
game with gaming rules or layouts that explicitly utilize specific programming concepts
(e.g., conditionals, arrays);
 2. a custom application programming interface (API) that
builds the game;
 3.  sample courseware materials that are classroom ready which include
PowerPoint slides, tutorials for the API, lab exercises, and assignments based on
simplified versions of the game; and 
4. an elaborate set of documentation."
* specific games to implement (e.g. Space Smasher)
* visual aides (e.g. pg 138)
* optional OO API that offers access to update function
     * also option of functional API that hides OO classes
     
* assignments include reading and editing already existing code to introduce concepts 

### findings 
"The challenges posed by the OO API has since been remedied with the functional
API as introduced in Section 4.2.2. Currently, the materials developed based on the
functional API are being field tested in UWB classes taught by tenure- and
teaching-track, and part-time faculty. None of these faculty are with prior experience teaching with videogames. Though the study has not concluded, the initial results suggest
students and faculty alike find the materials interesting where the stressful situations from
the previous academic year have not been observed."
* look for later-published studies
