# Goals
        "Our goal is thus to attract and retain majors without “watering
        down” the technical content of our classes. ...it is about engaging students with interesting
        assignments. If the assignments truly interest students then it stands
        to reason there should be a much higher probability of learning
        success and retention. We use games for this purpose" (115) 
The goal of this class are to:
* Create larger projects that solidify skills learned in the first two
quarters.
* Learn basic software software engineering concepts such as
UML class, sequence, and object diagrams as well as unit testing.
* Learn how to program using an API. In this case the API is
openGL.
* Learn how to work in groups.
        
## Methodology
1. Introduces objects with if statements that have an immediate effect:
    * introduces objects and tangible consequences of if statements 
    "illustrates a major asset of our approach: instant
    visual feedback for the student" (116)
2. introduces if/else, variables, creating classes, using classes and objects, 
   functions, scope, events 
3. introduce pointers, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, inheritance, and mutable data structures
4. Introduce graphics programming with OpenGL API 
5. All of these concepts are introduced and practiced with game development projects 

## Quality
* provides relevant statistics 
* provides qualitative and quantitative descriptions of data 
* provides goals and follows up on them
* operationalizes variables
