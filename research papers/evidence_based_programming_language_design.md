“we have used survey methods, usability studies, and field tests to help us design
the programming language and make it easier to use. We call such a language an
Evidence-Based Programming Language in the sense that we have continuously altered the syntax, semantics, and API design according to both our observational work
with novices and results from the literature.” -Stefik, Siebert, et al. (2011), p.3

“Analysis 35. Evidence-based programming language design (EB-PLD) should be
1. a decision procedure to resolve uncertainty
2. regarding a particular practical language design problem
3. applied by an individual language designer
4. consisting of five steps:
(a) formulating a question
(b) locating evidence
(c) appraising the evidence
(d) applying the evidence
(e) evaluating one’s own performance
Here, evidence means relevant published studies” (163)

“Thus, exactness will be interpreted as unambiguity in practice (instead of mathematical exactitude) and fruitfulness as having practical (in principle testable)
consequences” (164)

“At least three categories
of evaluation criteria exist:
– efficacy or the empirical capability of the design decision to benefit a programmer,
– efficiency or the empirical or theoretical capability of the design decision to
be implemented with low overhead, and
– safety or the theoretical property of the design decision that it not allow undefined behavior” (165)
