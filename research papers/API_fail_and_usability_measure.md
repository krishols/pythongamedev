"Formal documentation can be a crucial resource for learning to how to use an API. 
However, producing high-quality documentation can be nontrivial. Researchers investigated
how 10 common documentation problems manifested themselves in practice. The results are
based on two surveys of a total of 323 professional software developers and analysis of 
179 API documentation units. The three severest problems were ambiguity, incompleteness,
and incorrectness of content."

"Usability is therefore a fundamental goal of API design, but rigorous empirical studies
of API usability are still relatively uncommon. In this paper, we present the design 
of an API usability study which combines interview questions based on the cognitive 
dimensions framework, with systematic observations of programmer behavior while solving 
programming tasks based on ``tokens''.

### Developing API from patterns

"This paper suggests a method for developing graphical user interfaces based on generative
patterns. A generative pattern contains portions of previously designed user interfaces
are expressed through models that are either partially or totally instantiated."

I think these articles are important to reference/grow from in relation to how Kaijanaho 
defines the process of developing evidence-based programming languages/tools.
