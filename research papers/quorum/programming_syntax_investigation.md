## An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax - Stefik & Siebert

### misc
* acknowledge that the understanding of programming is multifaceted and human performance varies
    * determining syntactical solutions will not solve all programming challenges but will benefit
    students and new learners 
* despite different research methodology, their findings yielded similar results to past studies
such as Denny et al. (2011)
### supporting lit 
* Denny et al. (2011) 
    * in a 330 student empirical study with Java, they found that top quartile students submitted non-
    compiling source code ~half the time while bottom quartile submitted non-compiling code 73% of the time
        * thus, even students in intro courses struggle with syntax barriers 
    * conducted much work on tools for the blind and visually impaired 
        * observed that some programming languages presented more challenge to "read" with a screen reader
        for visually a blind student (Stefik et al. 2011) 
* Holt et al. created teaching programming languages SP/k (holt et al. 1977) and Turing (Holt and Cordy 1988)
with the goal of being intuitive and easy to use 
* Psychology of Programmers INterest Group or the abandoned Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP)
    * Ramalingam and Wiedenbeck (1997) show "quantitative experiment comparing comprehension with imperative and
    object-oriented styles" and "shows that language notations do influence novices"       
* recent literature demonstrates that syntax is a "significant barrier to novice computer science students in 
the field"
* (Kleinschmager et al. 2012; Mayeret al. 2012; Ramalingam and Wiedenbeck 1997; Rossbach et al. 2010)
* studies on alternative API designs and their impact on users (Stylos and Clarke 2007; Stylos and Myers 2008)
* "no observable benefits for using Python in training students for a CS2 C++ course" (6)(Enbody and Punch 2010;
Enbody et al. 2009)

#### aim 
* students have much to gain from controlled experiments reflecting program language design 
    * determining syntactic barriers may guide and contribute to instructors teaching capabilities and design (2)
* use randomized controlled trials that provide more detailed data and findings 
* "document how humans subjectively rate the intuitiveness of word and symbol choices representing
    computer programming concepts"..."gather formative clues as to what words and symbols might make sense
    to students" (studies 1 and 2)
* "Our goal with these surveyswas to give us clues into the kinds of constructs novices might ﬁnd easy 
to understand" (23) (studies 3 and 4)


#### methodology 
* conducted four empirical studies on syntax  
    
    ##### studies 1 and 2: surveys on programming language syntax
    * presented two surveys to students regarding inuitiveness of syntax, which they then used to understand user-
    friendly words for novices 
    * followed up with two studies on novices' accuracy rates in 6 languages 
    * "RQ1. Which words and symbols do novices find intuitive (or not intuitive) in a general purpose programming
    language?"
    * gave participants layman's terms of concepts and asked them to subjectively rate their intuitiveness
    
    ##### studies 3 and 4: novice accuracy rates 
    * measured novices' syntactic accuracy 
    * "RQ2. Can novices using programming languages for the ﬁrst time write simplecomputer programs more 
    accurately using alternative programming languages?" (24)
    * "computed a 'percent correct' metric for each task and used these values in our statistical models" (24)
    
#### dummy trials 
* " what if we took the key-word choices we ultimately found for Quorum (from Studies 1 and 2) and replaced 
them with random symbols from the ASCII table?" thus creating Randomo to determine if syntactic differences
among languages hold significance 
    
    
    
#### findings 
* "languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates 
significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate
 (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did" (1)
 * specific findings from syntax surveys are presented in tables in paper 
* "the between-subjects effect indicated a surprising result. While users of
 Quorum(Average M = .628, SD = .198) were able to program statistically signiﬁcantly more accurately
  than users of Perl (Average M = .432, SD = .179), p = .047, and usersof Randomo (Average M = .341, SD = .173),
   p = .004, Perl users were not able toprogram signiﬁcantly more accurately than Randomo users, p = .458" (30).
    * Perl being a language relatively like C
* "our result here shows clear evidence that syntax does inﬂuenceinitial novice accuracy, a claim we can make
 with high statistical conﬁdence" (30)
 * "1) syntax does matter to novices andaccuracy rates vary by language, and (2) careful observational data 
 can help us ﬁnd clues as to which tokens can be altered, modiﬁed, added, or removed to help novices use or 
 understand programming languages" (31)
 * "Perceived intuitiveness varies across word choices and language constructs" (35)
 * "Perceived intuitiveness varies between programmers and non-programmers" (35)
 * "Perceived intuitiveness varies across languages as a whole" (35)
 * "artifact Encoding and Token Accuracy Maps (TAMs) provide us a methodology for
 measuring novice programming accuracy" (35)
 * "Some programming languages may not afford accuracy rates much higher than placebo" (35)
 * " Novices may have initial difﬁculty with static type annotations" (35)
 * "Novice accuracy varies across language constructs" (35)
