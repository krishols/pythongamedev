# Updating Introductory Computer Science with Creative Computation 
### Goal
        Our goal was to strengthen formative/introductory CS education
        in high school and college by catalyzing excitement, creativity,
        and innovation. The digital representation of data, access to
        authentic sources of big data, and creative visualization
        techniques are revolutionizing intellectual inquiry in many
        disciplines, including the arts, social sciences, and humanities.
        We assert that CS1 should be updated with contemporary,
        diverse examples of computing in a modern context. (167)
        
         The remainder of this paper
        documents how a traditional CS1 over-arching structure, that
        emphasizes individual student creativity in the arts, can meet the
        needs of a diverse constituency and provide meaningful
        contextualization. (168)
        
 ## Methodology
         The curriculum follows a standard CS1 course, but
        instead of solving for roots of polynomials, simulating gas
        station/cash registers, or implementing well-known
        algorithms and techniques, our labs provide avenues for
        highly individual creative expressions to produce artwork,
        interactive multimedia, data visualizations, and games. (168) 
   
   Would have been interesting to compare the success of standard CS1 course 
   with the success of creative computing CS1
   
  It was also overwhelming to read the many adaptations to the curriculum. Multiple
  k-12 and college courses leads to many potential confounding variables. 
   
## Merit of success 

        Consequently,
        we report here on how the curriculum was successfully used by
        the simple standard that teachers self-evaluated their success,
        critiqued their short comings and articulated what they would
        improve in the next round. Throughout, the reporting has been
        consistently positive. (172) 
        
The authors acknowledge that quantitative data is not full proof in communicating
success and they instead rely on qualitative reflection from instructors. Would have
been meaningful to see more student input and some sort of valuable quantitative measure. 

## Quality of research

Very thorough qualitative measures. Provides appropriate descriptions of sample
in relation to the curriculum. 
Again, no quantitative data to support conclusions.
