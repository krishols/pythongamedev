## Notes 
    "However, as discussed in the next section, most
    of the existing work [regarding CS1 w/ game development] 
    is exploratory in nature and performed by faculty with 
    expertise in gaming/graphics. Their results usually lack
    generality and do not facilitate gradual adoption by 
    aculty that lack graphical/gaming expertise." 
    
* distinguises between game development (game content) and game programming
(programming content) 
* suitability for "selective adoption" of gaming was hard to come across 
in pre-existing libraries and per-assignment game dev. integration would be best.
    * interesting to consider and different from our perspective
        * we hope to use library for final project while authors consider
        large projects that require game engines to be too complex and take 
        too long to learn/teach/use in a limited amount of time
            * their assumption provides support for the necessity of a lightweight
            game library
