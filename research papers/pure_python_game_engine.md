The paper itself is not comprehensive of the game engine, but the link to the engine 
itself does not work. I tried typing it in manually and it takes me to the website of 
one of the authors but I can't locate the engine or the examples anywhere...Will
come back to this one. 

### Quality of documentation
The API in the paper is easy enough to read, given that the user has an 
understanding of object-oriented programming.

### Quality of examples
I can't find the code for the examples, but the pictures of the examples in the paper are
rather simple. The games are built upon basic shapes and colors. There doesn't appear 
to be an option of importing photos as sprites. 

### Ease of use of the library
The library looks fairly simple...but I think it's too simple. Not enough room for 
creativity that would appeal to students. 

### Features 
* #### Testing the game/drawing code: 
 I'm not sure if it offers this option and I won't be able to tell until I can find a link 
 to the engine
 
* #### Image manipulation 
Considering the engine doesn't facilitate the use of images...this isn't possible. 

* #### Requires the knowledge of making instances/subclasses
The API briefly describes how to make instances, but I think prior knowledge of
classes and subclasses would be useful in application. 

#### Context and Quality: 
* Student and instructor demographics were lacking in detail 
* Objectives didn't seem to be explicitly stated for the overall course, although
being a CS1 course I assume it was to provide a foundation of knowledge of programming 
* Activities included debugging: 

        "Bug #1. The code has a syntax error (someone made a
          modification and didn’t test it!). Fix it.
          
        Bug #3. There should be six cities, not two."
        
        Bug #4. Add a draw_stars function that randomly draws
        25 stars (points) at random locations in the background.
        Call it from an appropriate place in the game code.
        
        Bug #10. Add some simple game AI to demo mode so that
        the demo-mode “player” is not shooting randomly.
        
        This assignment was intended to give students practice understanding and working with code they didn’t create, a
        common task in practice" (95) 
        
        "The large assignment using the
        game engine was creating a version of Flappy Bird from
        scratch. Here, code for other games using the game engine
        were provided, as well as a YouTube video we made showing
        a sample solution in action." (95) 
* some program components were missing, such as date and duration of the program
and its activities 

#### Overall 
   The engine seems too simple. It does not offer image usage. 
   While reading the paper I felt more like I was being sold a game engine
    rather than learning about the value the engine had in relation to the students learning from it.
