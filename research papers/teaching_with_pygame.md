### Beginning of semester: 
Uses Pygame to teach basic programming skills: 
* sequential programming
* branching
* looping 
* file input/output

### After establishing programming skills: 

Uses Pygame to teach software objects and introduces object oriented programming. 
Asks students to develop a game with object oriented programming, using Pygame.
    
Results were very basic games, moving sprites across a screen with an imported 
background image. Not much more than that. Course did not use any libraries on top 
of Pygame and thus games were limited.
