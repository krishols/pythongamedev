## unusable: scope 
## come back to for: documentation-annotated example of code 
## Documentation
- provides example code with annotation prompting user to question the purpose
of code. useful option to consider. 
- refers to screen as "camera", "A camera defines what is visible". Language choice
that I have seen a few libraries use. I always just called it the window. Interesting
language aspect to consider. 
- does not seem to offer image manipulation.
