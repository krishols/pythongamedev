# What I am learning from unusable libraries 
## Documentation 
- I like the concept of documentation explicitly walking through "what 
is this code doing" (pgzero)
- Including tips regarding useful knowledge such as sites for usable images 
in public domain (pgzero)
## Testing 
- spyre offers ability to test code (i think)-worth coming back to 

## Tutorials
- miniworldmaker has well done tutorials 

## libraries worth returning to
- wasabi2D
- miniworldmaker
