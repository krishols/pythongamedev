# Spineless 
# Unusable: Outdated 
 last updated in 2005 
## "Spineless is an OpenGL accelerated generic game engine with Python scripting."
Still in "early stages of development"
### Installation 
LOTS to download 
"
Programs:
- Python interpreter: http://www.python.org
- SWIG for building the Python interface: http://www.swig.org
- Doxygen for building the documents: http://www.doxygen.org

Libraries:
- Expat for parsing XML: http://www.libexpat.org/
- OpenGL and GLU for rendering: http://www.opengl.org/
- SDL for graphics: http://www.libsdl.org/
- SDL_image for loading images: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
- libpng for loading PNG images: http://www.libpng.org/
- libjpeg for loading JPEG images: http://www.ijg.org/
- zlib, needed by libpng: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

The installation and way to even run the code was not simple/user or CS1 friendly 
### Properties
Kinda hard to decipher what the engine does have...as there is no documentation

### "TODO" or stuff the engine definitely does not have as of 2006 (last update)
Later:
- Audio
- Build: make optional libraries really optional
- Documentation: custom pages (at least front page)
- Documentation: examples and tutorials
- Graphics: anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering support
- Graphics: full screen toggling and resolution changing
- Graphics: lighting
- Graphics: list display modes
- Graphics: lost surface recovery
- Graphics: mipmap generation
- Graphics: OpenGL extensions
- Graphics: render targets
- Graphics: resizeable window
- Fonts: Freetype fonts
- Input: joystick handling
- Input: key / axis mapping
- Network
- Random number generator (Mersenne Twister)
- Scene manager
- Scene: Open Dynamics Engine
- Scene: Runge-Kutta integrator
- Scripting: better example and test scripts
- Scripting: interface documentation
- Scripting: multiple scripting language support (although Python probably
  remains as the only "official" one)
- Scripting: restricted execution
- Scripting: use SWIG directors for callbacks when they have matured a bit
  instead of custom Python API code
- Timer: time string formatting
- Timer: countdown
- Tools: font editor
- Tools: UI editor
- XML: writing
